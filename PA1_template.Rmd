This is an R Markdown document containing the full submission for the first project in the Johns Hopkins Reproducible Research course. 

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

There are 9 steps to this particular research project (not counting the submisstion).

Steps and results:

1 The code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data.

```{r chunk1}
activity <- unzip("repdata_data_activity.zip")
acts <- read.csv(activity)
acts$date <- as.Date(acts$date)
# write.csv(acts,"acts.csv")
summary(acts)
```

2 Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.

```{r chunk2}
daysteps <- aggregate(acts$steps, by=list(dayssteps=acts$date), FUN=sum)
# write.csv(daysteps,"daysteps.csv")
hist(daysteps$x, col = "green", xlab="Steps taken each day", ylab = "steps",
main="Total number of steps taken each day")
```

3 mean and median number of steps taken each day.

```{r chunk3}
mean(daysteps$x, na.rm = TRUE)
median(daysteps$x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

4 Time series pplot of the average number of steps taken

```{r chunk4}
acts1 <- na.omit(acts)
intsteps <- aggregate(acts1$steps, by=list(aveintsteps=acts1$interval), FUN=mean)
names(intsteps)[1] <- "row"
# write.csv(insteps,"insteps.csv")
plot(intsteps$row, intsteps$x, 
     type="l",
     xlab="Five Minute Interval",
     ylab="Average Steps",
     main="Time series plot of the average number of steps taken")
```

5 The 5-minute interval that, on average contains the maximumn number of steps.

```{r chunk5}
intsteps$row[which.max(intsteps$x)]
```

6 Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data

```{r chunk6}
# Find number of rows of NAs
NACount <- nrow(acts[acts$steps == "NA",])
NACount 

# Replace the NAs with average for the interval from step 4 
imputedata <- acts
for (i in 1:nrow(imputedata)) {
        if (is.na(imputedata$steps[i])) {
        # Find the index value for when the interval matches the average
        int <- which(imputedata$interval[i] == intsteps$row)
        # Assign the value to replace the NA
        imputedata$steps[i] <- intsteps[int,]$x
    }
}
# write.csv(imputedata,"imputedata.csv")
```

7 Histogram of the total number of steps that each day after missing values are imputed.

```{r chunk7}
impsteps <- aggregate(imputedata$steps, by=list(imputeddata=acts$date), FUN=sum)
# write.csv(daysteps,"daysteps.csv")
hist(impsteps$x, col = "blue", xlab="Steps taken each day", ylab = "steps",
main="Total number of steps taken each day using imputed missing values")

mean(impsteps$x)
median(impsteps$x)
```

Imputing values brought median and mean into alignment, but did not make a major difference between these values when we ignored the NAs. Totals obviously jumped.

8 Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends.  

```{r chunk8}
weekends <- imputedata
library(lubridate)
weekends$weekend <- wday(weekends$date)
for (i in 1:nrow(weekends)) {
        if (weekends$weekend[i] == 1 | weekends$weekend[i] == 7) {
                weekends$weekend[i] <- "Weekend"
        }
        else {
                weekends$weekend[i] <- "Weekday"
        }
}
# write.csv(weekends,"weekends.csv")
library(ggplot2)
qplot(interval, steps, data = weekends, 
      geom = "line", 
      xlab = "average steps taken", 
      ylab = "5 min. intervals",
      facets = weekend ~ .)
```

Analysis shows less early morning activity and more late night activity on weekends.
